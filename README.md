# Disjoint-Domain-Classifier

Image Classification.

Dataset has 4 Training Domains (D1 - D4) and a set of unknown test domains. Each of those training domains will contain disjoint 4-5 classes. The test domains together contain all 18 seen classes.

The goal is to come up with a single model that can perform well on any domain
